# weather-dashboard
A simple weather dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display real-time weatherÂ information.
It allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
The app also displays a 5-day weather forecast fetched dynamically from the OpenWeather API.
Designed with a clean, responsive layout for easy viewing across devices.
This project demonstrates API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/async-await), and DOM manipulation skills.
